Jmz XMR
=

This is highly deprecated and isn't being maintained anymore.  There are a few bugs but overall works like its supposed to.

I created this because I am a huge fan of self hosting anything and everything.  And since Monero is meant to be private, only made sense to have full control over monitoring

Features:
* Password protected
* Able to monitor XMRig based miners
* Telegram notification status updates are available
* Completely open source
* Android app available for easier monitoring
* Monitor pools for reporting

Installation
=
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jmztaylor/jmzxmr.git
cd jmzxmr
docker-compose up --build -d
```

If you don't want to use docker then just change the database details in config.php and put all files in the proper location.
